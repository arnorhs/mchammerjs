#MCHammer - model-controller framework

A very simple event-structured framework for developing complex javascript
applications/interactions.

It makes for a unified and simple structure when you would otherwise have
a lot of deeply nested interactions, passing data and objects back and
forth.

It makes your code base essentially flat, uses very little memory and
allows the code to become very understandable.

It makes speghetti code less unpredictable since all functions are always
called within the same scope, so passing objects and data around becomes
predictable and you won't have scope-creep.

Examples etc coming up sometime in the near future (measured in decades)
